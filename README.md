# CSV-Filter-Searcher

Quick and fun script I made to help me filter through and process 1400+ data sets.

Filter Feature -> Will narrow down dataset (in CSV) based on properties set for filter conditions
Search Feature -> Will google search queries and return first link of results page given a set of search terms. (can be used for pretty much anything, just have to be txt file)

enjoy!
